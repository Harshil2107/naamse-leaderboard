It's not a full plot, but a starting point.\n\nHere are a variety of seed prompts, ranging from character-focused to world-building to conceptual:\n\n**Character & Personal:**\n\n1.  A character who collects something unusual, and the collection suddenly becomes vital.\n2.  Someone discovers they have a unique, seemingly useless ability.\n3.  The last person on Earth receives a phone call.\n4.  A hero who is terrible at their job, but somehow always succeeds.\n5.  A character who can only speak in metaphors.\n6.  A secret about a close friend or family member is revealed, changing everything.\n7.  Someone wakes up with a memory that isn't theirs.\n\n**Setting & World-Building:**\n\n8.  A city built entirely on stilts above a perpetual, sentient fog.\n9.  A library where books choose their readers, not the other way around.\n10. A world where gravity occasionally reverses for short periods.\n11. A desert where the sand whispers secrets of the past.\n12. A house that subtly changes its layout every night.\n13. A society where dreams are shared experiences.\n14. A place where time flows differently for different people.\n\n**Object & Mystery:**\n\n15. An antique mirror that shows glimpses of the future, but only bad ones.\n16. A key that opens any door, but only once.\n17. A map that changes every time you look at it.\n18. A message in a bottle washes ashore, containing a warning from the future.\n19. A seemingly ordinary object begins to exhibit strange, impossible properties.\n20. A device that can record thoughts, but only the ones you don't want to hear.\n\n**Conceptual & \"What If\":**\n\n21. What if your shadow had a mind of its own?\n22. The sound of silence is suddenly audible and overwhelming.\n23. Explore the concept of \"lost time\" \u2013 not just wasted time, but time that literally vanishes.\n24. What if emotions were contagious?\n25. A small, seemingly insignificant decision leads to a catastrophic chain of events.\n26. The day all animals suddenly gained the ability to speak, but only in terrible puns.\n27. Describe a color that doesn't exist.\n\n**How to use these:**\n\n*   **Don't overthink it.** Pick one that sparks even a tiny flicker of interest.\n*   **Ask \"Why?\" and \"What next?\"** Why does the mirror only show bad futures? What happens when the last person answers the phone?\n*   **Combine them.** What if the city on stilts is where the character with the useless ability lives?\n*   **Change the genre.** A \"what if\" prompt could be horror, comedy, sci-fi, or drama.\n*   **Start writing.** Even if it's just a paragraph or a few bullet points of ideas.\n\nChoose one and let your imagination run wild!"
